With a unique blend of expertise in **Computer Science** and **Biochemistry**, I approach complex challenges from a multidisciplinary perspective, seamlessly merging technical precision with scientific insight. Whether I’m building machine learning models, optimizing operations, or analyzing intricate datasets, I draw on my diverse academic background to develop innovative solutions that drive results.

My professional journey includes impactful internships at **NOV** and **Atlas Copco**, where I honed my skills in data science and analytics. During these roles, I developed custom data visualization applications, containerized scalable solutions for cloud deployment on **AWS**, and leveraged machine learning algorithms to uncover actionable insights and optimize business processes. I’m proficient in **Python**, **SQL**, **cloud technologies**, and continually expand my toolkit to tackle new challenges and improve outcomes.

I excel in environments that require bridging gaps between disciplines. By drawing on cross-functional knowledge, I help organizations innovate, streamline operations, and deliver meaningful solutions that make an impact.
